The code below have passed Moulinette. The only issue (that wasn't caught by Moulinette, but evaluators pointed it out) is an additional condition in ft_atoi.c.

Real atoi returns (-1) or (0) is it is iveflowed in long long. It is important to add such a case to ft_atoi.c.

## ft_printf
testers I used:
1) Francinette and Francinette --strict. Very useful in catching errors.
